                <p class="card-text">In 2023, I proudly graduated from the UF College of Education in Education Science, with a GPA of 3.76—not bad for a 49-year-old single mother. Yet, I didn't want to stop there; I am now pursuing a master's degree in Journalism. This field is my passion and deeply rooted in my family's tradition, as my mother and two of her sisters studied the same discipline. While my mother focused on art and writing novels, my aunts were activists who faced imprisonment in the 1970s due to an oppressive government. They fought for the rights of young men opposing that regime. Today, my aunt has been a role model for generations involved in journalism. She passed away in 2005, but her legacy continues to inspire me. On a different note, I needed to learn Web Development. The beginning was challenging, but now I'm thoroughly enjoying every step of the journey. I'm eager to become proficient in web design, and who knows—maybe this will be my next path in continuing education.

                  </p>
                <p class="card-text mb-0">I would like to highlight that I graduated from law school in the Dominican Republic in 2002. While the legal frameworks in the Dominican Republic differ from those in the United States, the knowledge and experience I gained have greatly enriched my understanding of various legal aspects in our country. This background has proven invaluable in carefully structuring documents to safeguard both my rights and those of others. I am thankful for my decision to pursue further education, which has enhanced my competitiveness in the professional field.</p>

                <p class="card-text mb-0">I have a strong affinity for traditional hobbies. Crafting is a passion of mine, and my home is filled with boxes of yarn for knitting and crocheting. I particularly enjoy dedicating time to these activities around Thanksgiving and during the winter holidays in order to create handmade items for my family and closest friends. Sewing is another one of my interests, and I have crafted pants and pajamas for my daughter and myself. It's quite amusing when we match colors. Dealing with Asperger's and ADHD presents its own set of challenges, particularly in managing mood and anxiety. To cope, I always keep a small red sketchbook and pencils on hand to illustrate anything that comes to mind, from tiny mountain cabins to trees adorned with small leaves. I believe it's crucial for individuals to find solace and detach from the world's complexities.</p>

                  <li class="list-group-item">Advocating for individuals with disabilities is a top priority for me, especially for those with intellectual disabilities who are high-functioning but may face challenges due to societal attitudes toward different ways of thinking. I am actively urging universities to incorporate specialized training for instructors and professors to support better students like myself, who may encounter difficulties in some areas but are confident in their abilities in others. My goal is not to seek special treatment for individuals with conditions like mine but to promote understanding and tolerance for diverse approaches while respecting everyone's self-esteem. More than race or religion for diversity, our colleges and universities must include authentic inclusion as part of diversity and accept all American students and professionals have the right to think differently without causing damage to anyone. Like Temple Grandin once said: "Different, but not less."</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">Develop programs aligned with the Florida Department of Education to integrate into the elementary school curriculum. These programs should focus on teaching young children valuable skills early, such as enhanced arts and crafts activities like painting and origami. Additionally, there should be an emphasis on organizing annual statewide school art exhibitions and securing funding to sustain these activities. This initiative aims to stimulate children's creativity and reduce their dependence on electronic devices at home. It also encourages the quality of time spent between parents or guardians and their children. By the age of 10, children should have acquired interesting skills, similar to some students in the Dominican Republic who have learned to build kites and have even turned this activity into a profitable venture, fostering a healthy and creative mindset.</li>
